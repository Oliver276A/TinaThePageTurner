# Automatic Page Turner - Final Report

## Components and tools required
- **Electronic**
    1. 180 degrees servo (Feetech FS90) - For the turning stick
    2. Continuous servo (Feetech FS90R) - For the wheel
    3. Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) - Need I say more?
- **Structural**
    1. Structural material of choice - I used some hard cardboard which is readily available but wood or metal will also work
    2. Adhesives - Some tape and some hot glue
    3. Torsion springs - This is to put pressure between the page and the wheel; An easy alternative is a clothespeg! (Note that the angle cannot be too small - More on this later.)
- **Tools**
    1. Scissors and cutters
    2. Hot glue gun
