# Tina "the Automatic Page" Turner

Like the name suggests, Tina turns pages for piano players. Turning pages is a headache for many musicians. Although today some use tablets to read sheet music, they are expensive and do not provide the same level of convenience to musicians, such as when it comes to annotating their sheets, as physical sheet music. In addition, musicians must scan their sheet music to the tablets before using them. There have been some attempts to create an automatic page turner. However, some require extensive setup and are impractical for musicians.

Thus, the goal of Tina, is to provide musicians with a solution that is cheap, simple and practical. There is no fancy machinery or expensive devices, and the entire setup does not weigh more than a pound.

## Overview and Features

- The robot is activated by hovering one's hand within 5cm from the ultrasonic sensor for 3 seconds
- When the robot is activated, the ultrasonic sensor senses a signal (triggered within 30cm from the sensor) and triggers the page turning mechanism
- The wheel spins to grab the page
- The turning stick completes the page turning motion

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software:
- Arduino IDE
- Basic Arudino knowledge
- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account

### Installation

1. Decide where you want to store the repository (Documents/School, for example)
2. Using the command prompt/terminal, navigate to the directory
```bash
cd documents/school
```
3. Make sure you have logged into Git
4. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oliver276A/TinaThePageTurner.git
```
5. Once cloned, you can now navigate to project directory for Tina the Page Turner!
```bash
cd TinaThePageTurner
```
6. You can now explore Tina by the command `code .`. Enjoy!
