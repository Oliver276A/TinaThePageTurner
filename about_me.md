# My name is Oliver Mui

I speak four languages:
    1. Cantonese
    2. Mandarin
    3. English
    4. French

I am also trying to learn Punjabi, and have learnt German and Spanish in the past.

Here's a random Arduino code that I found...:
```arduino
//the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board

void setup() {

// initialize digital pin 13 as an output.

pinMode(13, OUTPUT);

}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever

void loop() {

digitalWrite(13, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)

delay(1000); // wait for a second

digitalWrite(13, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW

delay(1000); // wait for a second

}

```
