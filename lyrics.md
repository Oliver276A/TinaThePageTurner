[Intro]
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire
You come to me, come to me, wild and wired
Ooh, you come to me, give me everything I need

[Verse 1]
Give me a lifetime of promises and a world of dreams
Speak the language of love like you know what it means
Mm, and it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong, baby

[Chorus]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart? No, no
Baby, I would rather be dead

[Verse 2]
In your heart I see the start of every night and every day
In your eyes, I get lost, I get washed away
Just as long as I'm here in your arms
I could be in no better place
